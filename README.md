# TIL website

This is a small website made using ReactJS to display my TILs (Today I Learned).

Build the website using `npm run build` and deploy the contents of the `build` directory to your server.

Production Deploy:

```bash
PUBLIC_URL="https://til.sanyamkhurana.com" npm run build
npm run deploy
```
